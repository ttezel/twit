#twit

Twitter API Client for node

Supports both the **REST** and **Streaming** API.

#Installing

```
npm install twit

```

##Usage:

```javascript
var Twit = require('twit')

var T = new Twit({
    consumer_key:         '...'
  , consumer_secret:      '...'
  , access_token:         '...'
  , access_token_secret:  '...'
})

//
//  tweet 'hello world!'
//
T.post('statuses/update', { status: 'hello world!' }, function(err, reply) {
  //  ...
})

//
//  retweet a tweet with the id_str of '241259202004267009'
//
T.post('statuses/retweet', { id: '241259202004267009' }, function(err, reply) {
  //  ...
})
      
//
//  search twitter for all tweets containing the word 'banana' since Nov. 11, 2011
//
T.get('search/tweets', { q: 'banana since:2011-11-11' }, function(err, reply) {
  //  ...
})

//
//  get the list of user id's that follow @tolga_tezel
//
T.get('followers/ids', { screen_name: 'tolga_tezel' },  function (err, reply) {
  //  ...    
})

//
//  stream a sample of public statuses
//
var stream = T.stream('statuses/sample')

stream.on('tweet', function (tweet) {
  console.log(tweet)
})
      
//
//  filter the twitter public stream by the word 'mango'. 
//
var stream = T.stream('statuses/filter', { track: 'mango' })

stream.on('tweet', function (tweet) {
  console.log(tweet)
})

//
// filter the public stream by the latitude/longitude bounded box of San Francisco
//
var sanFrancisco = [ '-122.75', '36.8', '-121.75', '37.8' ]

var stream = T.stream('statuses/filter', { locations: sanFrancisco })

stream.on('tweet', function (tweet) {
  console.log(tweet)
})

```

# twit API:

Just 3 methods. They cover the full twitter API.

##`T.get(path, [params], callback)`         
GET any of the REST API Endpoints.

##`T.post(path, [params], callback)`        
POST any of the REST API Endpoints.

##`T.stream(path, [params])`               
Use this with the Streaming API.

Note: Omit the `.json` from `path` (i.e. use `'statuses/sample'` instead of `'statuses/sample.json'`).

###params

Params is an optional object, allowing you to pass in parameters to Twitter when making a request. Any Arrays passed into `params` get converted to comma-separated strings, allowing you to do requests like:

```javascript
//
// I only want to see tweets about my favorite fruits
//

//same result as doing { track: 'bananas,oranges,strawberries' }
var stream = T.stream('statuses/filter', { track: ['bananas', 'oranges', 'strawberries'] })

stream.on('tweet', function (tweet) {
  //...
})
```

# Using the Streaming API

`T.stream(path, [params])` keeps the connection alive, and returns an `EventEmitter`.

###path


* If `path` is `'user'`, the User stream of the authenticated user will be streamed.
* If `path` is `'site'`, the Site stream of the authenticated application will be streamed.
* If `path` is anything other than `'user'` or `'site'`, the Public stream will be streamed.

The following events are emitted:

##event: 'tweet'

Emitted each time a status (tweet) comes into the stream.

```javascript
stream.on('tweet', function (tweet) {
  //...
})
```

##event: 'delete'

Emitted each time a status (tweet) deletion message comes into the stream.

```javascript
stream.on('delete', function (deleteMessage) {
  //...
})
```

##event: 'limit'

Emitted each time a limitation message comes into the stream.

```javascript
stream.on('limit', function (limitMessage) {
  //...
})
```

##event: 'scrub_geo'

Emitted each time a location deletion message comes into the stream.

```javascript
stream.on('scrub_geo', function (scrubGeoMessage) {
  //...
})
```

##event: 'disconnect'

Emitted when a disconnect message comes from Twitter. This occurs if you have multiple streams connected to Twitter's API. Upon receiving a disconnect message from Twitter, `Twit` will close the connection and emit this event with the message details received from twitter.

```javascript
stream.on('disconnect', function (disconnectMessage) {
  //...
})
```

##event: 'connect'

Emitted when a connection attempt is made to Twitter. The http `request` object is emitted.

```javascript
stream.on('connect', function (request) {
  //...
})
```

##event: 'reconnect'

Emitted when a reconnection attempt is made to Twitter. The http `request` and `response` objects are emitted, along with the time (in milliseconds) left before the reconnect occurs. `Twit` follows Twitter's guidelines on reconnecting to the Streaming API.

```javascript
stream.on('reconnect', function (request, response, connectInterval) {
  //...
})
```

##event: 'warning'

This message is appropriate for clients using high-bandwidth connections, like the firehose. If your connection is falling behind, Twitter will queue messages for you, until your queue fills up, at which point they will disconnect you.

```javascript
stream.on('warning', function (warning) {
  //...
})
```

##event: 'status_withheld'

Emitted when Twitter sends back a `status_withheld` message in the stream. This means that a tweet was withheld in certain countries.

```javascript
stream.on('status_withheld', function (withheldMsg) {
  //...
})
```

##event: 'user_withheld'

Emitted when Twitter sends back a `user_withheld` message in the stream. This means that a Twitter user was withheld in certain countries.

```javascript
stream.on('user_withheld', function (withheldMsg) {
  //...
})
```

##event: 'friends'

Emitted when Twitter sends the ["friends" preamble](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis/messages#User_stream_messages) when connecting to a user stream. This message contains a list of the user's friends, represented as an array of user ids.

```javascript
stream.on('friends', function (friendsMsg) {
  //...
})
```

##event: 'user_event'

Emitted when Twitter sends back a [User stream event](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis/messages#User_stream_messages).  
See the Twitter docs for more information on each event's structure.

```javascript
stream.on('user_event', function (eventMsg) {
  //...
})
```

In addition, the following user stream events are provided for you to listen on: 

* `blocked`
* `unblocked`
* `favorite`
* `unfavorite`
* `follow`
* `unfollow`
* `user_update`
* `list_created`
* `list_destroyed`
* `list_updated`
* `list_member_added`
* `list_member_removed`
* `list_user_subscribed`
* `list_user_unsubscribed`
* `unknown_user_event` (for an event that doesn't match any of the above)

###Example:

```javascript
stream.on('favorite', function (event) {
  //...
})
```

##stream.stop()

Call this function on the stream to stop streaming (closes the connection with Twitter).

##stream.start()

Call this function to restart the stream after you called `.stop()` on it.
Note: there is no need to call `.start()` to begin streaming. `Twit.stream` calls `.start()` for you.

#What do I have access to?

Anything in the Twitter API:

* REST API Endpoints:       https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api
* Public stream endpoints:  https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-api/methods
* User stream endpoints:    https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-api/user-streams
* Site stream endpoints:    https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-api/site-streams

-------

Go here to create an app and get OAuth credentials (if you haven't already): https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new


#How do I run the tests?

Create a `config.js` at the root of the `twit` folder. It should export the oauth credentials. It should look something like this:

```
module.exports = {
    consumer_key: '...'
  , consumer_secret: '...'
  , access_token: '...'
  , access_token_secret: '...'
}
```

Then run the tests:

```
npm test
```

You can also run the example:

```
node examples/rtd2.js
```

![iRTD2](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/32773572/RTD2_logo.png)

The example is a twitter bot named [RTD2](https://twitter.com/#!/iRTD2) written using `twit`. RTD2 tweets about **github** and curates its social graph.

## Changelog

###1.0.0
  * now to stop and start the stream, use `stream.stop()` and `stream.start()` instead of emitting the `start` and `stop` events
  * If twitter sends a `disconnect` message, closes the stream and emits `disconnect` with the disconnect message received from twitter

###0.2.0
  * Updated `twit` for usage with v1.1 of the Twitter API.

###0.1.5

  * **BREAKING CHANGE** to `twit.stream()`. Does not take a callback anymore. It returns 
    immediately with the `EventEmitter` that you can listen on. The `Usage` section in 
    the Readme.md has been updated. Read it.


###0.1.4

  * `twit.stream()` has signature `function (path, params, callback)`
